# A Pali Keyboard for OS X

This is a Keyboard Layout for the Pali language (romanized) to be used on OS X.
It is based on Toshiya Unebe's beautiful EasyUnicode, and adds the symbol ŋ to be
used with the online [Pali dictionary](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/pali/).

As suggested by Lawrence Taylor, ŋ is added on Opt+b.
The layout is produced with Ukelele.

## Install
1. Copy the directory `Pali.bundle` to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
1. Restart
1. Go to System Preference, Keyboard, Input Sources and add the Pali Layout from 'Others'

If you want to add more keys or change the arrangement feel free to contact me.
